# MapVision

## Goals
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
1 - This project consists of using 2 mono cameras in 1 stereo camera to be implemented in the I3E-D3 and make the 3D mapping - through ROS (Robot Operating System).<p>

2 - Make Cimatec 3D mapping for I3E-D3 navigation.<p>
3 - ROS learning from RAS volunteers in the project.<p>
4 - Measure the distance of objects with the stereo camera.<p>
</div>

## What will happen after the project is finished
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
It will be an implementation in D3 and will serve as a learning experience for the team.
</div>

## Relationship with Cimatec
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Not necessary.
</div>

## Necessary knowledge

- Programming;
- Open CV;
- ROS;
- SLAM;
- Medium complexity .

## Budget

| Material |  Quantity  | Price(unit)    |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Webcam   | 2          | 59,90          |
|          |            |                |
|          |            |                |

## Scratchs
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Quality of joining 2 mono cameras is compromised
In the last case buy a stereo or depth cam(KINECT) and do the 3D mapping with it.
